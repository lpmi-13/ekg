# Contributing to EKG

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to the EKG. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment,
and feel free to propose changes to this document in a Pull Request.

Your Pull Request will be reviewed by one of the maintainers. We encourage and welcome any and all feedback from the community.

## Making a Pull Request

Please make a fork of the repo, and summit a PR from there. More information can
be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).

Prerequisites (that software has to be installed on developer's machine)
    - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
    - [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install)
    - [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads)
    - [TFLint](https://github.com/terraform-linters/tflint#installation)
    - [terraform-docs](https://terraform-docs.io/user-guide/installation)

To update a part of the docs that is autogenerated from Terraform configuration (any changes in it may force docs update) run

```bash
ci/generate-docs.sh
```

and commit it to the repository (otherwise CI checks won't pass).

to install the required dependencies and ensure all checks pass, first perform the below command

```bash
npm install
```

And then run all checks, executing the following command

```bash
npm run check-all
```

which executes checks for spelling, markdown files, redundant whitespace, and up-to-date autogenerated documentation.

Configuration for them is in the below files

- [package.json](./package.json) - what checks are available (you don't need to always run all of them locally)

- [cspell.json](./cspell.json) - missing words can be added to the dictionary (please maintain alphabetical order,
    it is checked by a special check too)

- [.markdownlint.json](./.markdownlint.json) - rules can be adjusted for files with `.md` extension

### Pull Request title
